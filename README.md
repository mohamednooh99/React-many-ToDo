<h1 align="center"> <strong>React To-Do Project</strong></h1>
<p>This project is a collection of various interactive UI components built with <strong>React.js.</strong> Each component represents a unique functionality, including a To-Do list with navigation controls, a flip card, an accordion item, a billing system, and a counter. The project showcases the power and flexibility of React by implementing dynamic, reusable components that can be used in various applications.</p>

<h1>Features</h1>

**1. To-Do List with Next/Previous Navigation** 
A fully functional To-Do list where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and navigate through the list using Next and Previous buttons.
The state management is handled using React's useState and useEffect hooks, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

**2. Flip Card Component**
An interactive Flip Card that flips to reveal additional content on the backside when clicked over.
This component demonstrates the use of CSS animations and React's state management to create a visually engaging experience.

**3. Accordion Item**
A collapsible Accordion that expands to reveal hidden content when clicked. Multiple accordion items can be used together to create an organized, space-saving layout.
This component is designed with accessibility in mind and is implemented using React's useState hook to manage the accordion's open and closed states.

**4. Billing Component with Satisfaction Feedback**
The billing system component allows users to input the amount of their bill and rate the quality of service for both themselves and their friends. Depending on their satisfaction levels, a discount or surcharge could be applied to the final total.

**5. Counter**
A Counter Component that allows users to increment or decrement a value. The counter also demonstrates state management and reactivity in React.
The counter is styled for a modern look and can easily be integrated into larger applications that require quantity control or numeric inputs.

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>

**React.js:** The core framework used to build the entire project.

**JavaScript (ES6+):** Modern JavaScript features were used to create dynamic and functional components.

**CSS Modules or Styled Components:** For component-level styling that ensures scoped and maintainable CSS.

**React Hooks (useState, useEffect):** Used extensively throughout the project for state management and lifecycle management. 

The project is organized into multiple components, each handling a specific feature or functionality.
Components are modular and can be easily reused or adapted in other projects.
